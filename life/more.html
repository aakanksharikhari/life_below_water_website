        <h1><font color="red">WAY TO PROTECT MARINE LIFE</font></h1>
        <h1>1. Pick Up Trash, and Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle Plastic </h1>
        <p>One of the big reasons animals arrive at our hospital is due to pollution. Turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, birds get entangled in fishing line, and animals get stuck in plastic wrappings. These are all things that can easily be avoided by simply disposing of our trash correctly, recycling and reducing plastic use. Picking up any trash you see can help, and if you are feeling extra ambitious you can even organize your own cleanup. Spending a beautiful day on the beach, surrounded by friends, all while saving the ocean, what could be better than that?</p>
        <h1>2. Conserve Water</h1>
        <p>Did you ever consider that saving the environment could also save you money as well?! It sure can, by following a couple easy steps; your average monthly water bill can be greatly reduced. Checking for leaks consistently, not running water while completing tasks like brushing your teeth, changing out showerheads to a low flow model, and even reusing water for things like watering the plants has the ability to not only save water but your pocketbook as well</p>
        <h1>3. Know Where Your Food Comes From</h1>
        <p>Another way to help the ocean is by paying attention to where your seafood comes from. While it may seem as if the ocean is abundant and full of a never-ending supply of fish, this may not always be the case. Due to overfishing, a lack of environmental-minded management, and our own consumption habits, our fish populations are declining. Not only is this a problem for the fish themselves, but also to the communities that rely on the fishing industry for their income. In order to ensure that these fish populations thrive, and fishermen continue to have jobs, there are easy steps we can take!

 

            One of the simplest things the public can do is ask local grocery stores and restaurants if they sell sustainable seafood. If consumers make it known that sustainable food is what they are going to buy, eventually that is what stores will sell! Another easy thing to do is to download a sustainable seafood app! These interactive apps give you recommendations for places near you that serve sustainable food, search for seafood quickly by its common market name, and allow access to notes and reports on conservation.</p>
        <h1>4. Be an Ocean-Friendly Pet Owner></h1>
        <p>While it is common courtesy to pick up after your pet, it can also help save the ocean! Dogs and cats produce 10 million tons of waste each year in the U.S. alone. This waste can be harmful to water supplies. When it rains, that carries the waste into rivers, beaches and bays introducing harmful bacteria to those areas. If the amount of bacteria gets too high it could be unsafe for drinking and swimming. An easy fix is to always pick up your pets’ waste! There are even biodegradable poop bags available, to minimize the use of plastic.

            As for all of the cat lovers, it is important to know which litter to purchase. Some cat litters contain carcinogenic silica dust that can even be harmful to your cat.  Buying eco-friendly cat litter can eliminate the risk for your cat, and the ocean. And another important thing to remember is never flush your pet’s waste down the toilet! That leads it directly to the water.</p>
